## 3. üéØ Problem Statement & Goals

### 3.1 The Problem: Fragmentation & High Overhead
Dental practices are burdened by administrative fragmentation (using 6+ systems) and high labor overhead.
1.  **HR/Finance Silos:** Payroll and scheduling data are disconnected from financial reports, leading to manual error and compliance risk.
2.  **Marketing Inconsistency:** Practices lack an easy way to create, review, and consistently publish high-quality, authoritative **dental content** (articles/news) and timely **patient offers**.

### 3.2 MouthMetrics Project Goals (SMART)
| Goal ID | Goal Description | Metric / Success Criteria | Status Tag |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| G-01 | Achieve Product-Market Fit (MVP) | $\geq 50$ paying customers within 12 months post-launch | **Accent** |
| G-02 | **Reduce Administrative Overhead** | Practices report a $\geq 40\%$ reduction in time spent on monthly payroll/invoicing tasks. | **Primary** |
| G-03 | **Establish Practice Authority** | Users successfully publish $\geq 1$ original, reviewed article per month. | **Accent** |
